# Advent of Code 2020

My Python solutions to the 2020 edition of the [annual programming puzzle calendar](https://adventofcode.com/). All solutions rely only on the standard Python library.

## How to run the solutions

All the solutions are standalone Python scripts without any external dependencies. So for example to run a solution for day 24:

```bash
python aoc/day24/puzzle.py
```
